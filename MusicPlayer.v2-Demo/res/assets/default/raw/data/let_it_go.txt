[00:14.08]The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
[00:17.19]Not a footprint to be seen
[00:20.86]A kingdom of isolation,
[00:24.30]and it looks like I m the Queen
[00:28.55]The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
[00:35.58]Couldn t keep it in; Heaven knows I ve tried
[00:42.59]Don t let them in, don t let them see
[00:45.91]Be the good girl you always have to be
[00:49.40]Conceal, don t feel, don t let them know
[00:55.76]Well now they know
[00:59.14]Let it go, let it go
[01:02.61]Can t hold it back anymore
[01:06.17]Let it go, let it go
[01:09.39]Turn away and slam the door
[01:13.18]I don t care what they re going to say
[01:19.82]Let the storm rage on
[01:24.21]The cold never bothered me anyway
[01:31.69]It s funny how some distance
[01:34.31]Makes everything seem small
[01:37.75]And the fears that once controlled me
[01:41.18]Can t get to me at all
[01:45.66]It s time to see what I can do
[01:49.20]To test the limits and break through
[01:52.80]No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
[01:56.94]I m free!
[02:00.40]Let it go, let it go
[02:03.87]I am one with the wind and sky
[02:07.21]Let it go, let it go
[02:10.75]You ll never see me cry
[02:14.49]Here I stand
[02:18.22]And here I ll stay
[02:21.62]Let the storm rage on
[02:33.36]My power flurries through the air into the ground
[02:39.79]My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
[02:46.80]And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
[02:53.73]I m never going back, the past is in the past
[03:01.78]Let it go, let it go
[03:05.31]And I ll rise like the break of dawn
[03:08.60]Let it go, let it go
[03:12.19]That perfect girl is gone
[03:16.25]Here I stand
[03:18.87]In the light of day
[03:24.85]Let the storm rage on
[03:30.09]The cold never bothered me anyway!
[03:35.32]
